🚀 Passionate Full Stack Web Developer & Strategic Stock Market Enthusiast 🖥️📈

👨‍💻 Greetings! I am Chirag Yadav, a dynamic Full Stack Web Developer. Holding a stellar 97 score in Computer Science from ICSE in 10th grade and excelling in 12th grade from CBSE in Agra, I am also honoured with the UP Genius Award.

💻 Proficient in a comprehensive tech stack including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node.js, REST, SQL, MongoDB, React, Tailwind, and Redux – I am a full-stack powerhouse. My successful projects, such as the recent E-commerce website, highlight my expertise in creating seamless web experiences.

🌐 Beyond Full Stack, my journey encompasses a strong foundation in C++, Java, C, and JavaScript. Solving over 1K+ problems in Data Structures and Algorithms, I maintain a POTD streak of over 120 on GeeksforGeeks and LeetCode, securing a spot among the top 100 coders in university. My Java-based Android Bluetooth message app is a testament to my continuous exploration of new technologies.

📚 A devoted reader, I recently immersed myself in "Atomic Habits," aligning my passion with disciplined habits. In between coding sessions, you'll find me immersed in a game of chess ♟️, fueling my strategic thinking. My organizational contributions include orchestrating Ganesh Chaturthi on a hostel level and participating in 'Har Ghar Tiranga,' contributing to the largest human wave Flag Formation.

💡 As a team player and problem solver, I actively seek growth opportunities. Armed with hands-on experience in web development and certified credentials from Internshala, Coursera, Apna College, and Infosys, I am well-prepared for new challenges.

📊 A two-time 30-day challenge winner of FYRES, I also don the hat of a stock market trader, showcasing a diverse skill set in the financial realm.
